## Sports Aviation Management System CMS

I developed a **Content Management System (CMS)** specifically designed to manage content for mobile applications. This robust system empowers businesses to efficiently and securely handle their digital content. Below are the key features and tools used in this project:

### Key Features

  Implemented RBAC to ensure users have tailored permissions, accessing only the features and content relevant to their roles. This enhances security and streamlines workflows.

- **Intuitive Content Management:**  
  Designed seamless content creation, editing, and management interfaces. Users can easily handle text, images, videos, and documents, making content management effortless.

- **Scheduled Content Publication:**  
  Enabled flexibility by allowing users to schedule content for publication at specific dates and times. Content can also be published or unpublished on demand, aligning with marketing campaigns and engagement strategies.

- **Integrated Analytics:**  
  Provided valuable insights into content performance and user engagement through integrated analytics. Track key metrics to refine content strategies and optimize digital experiences.

- **Dynamic Report Generation:**  
  Simplified the generation of comprehensive reports, offering actionable insights into content effectiveness and user behavior. These reports support informed decision-making and continuous improvement.
